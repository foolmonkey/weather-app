						Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to
						want functions that can take a location and return the
						weather data for that location. For now, just
						console.log() the information.
					</li>
					<li>
						Write the functions that <em>process</em> the JSON data
						you’re getting from the API and return an object with
						only the data you require for your app.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set up a simple form that will let users input their
						location and will fetch the weather info (still just
						console.log() it).
					</li>
					<li>Display the information on your webpage!</li>
					<li>Add any styling you like!</li>
					<li>
						Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from
						the time the form is submitted until the information
						comes back from the API.
					</li>
					<li>
						Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
